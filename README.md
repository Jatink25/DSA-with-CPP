# DSA-Journey 🚀

This repository contains my personal journey of learning **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** using **C++**.

The goal of this repo is not just to solve problems, but to:
- Build strong core concepts
- Understand problem-solving patterns
- Prepare effectively for technical interviews

## Structure

Problems are organized topic-wise for better understanding and revision.
